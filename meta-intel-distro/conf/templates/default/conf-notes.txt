You can now run 'bitbake <target>'

Specific Intel AXXIA targets are:
    axxia-image-run
    axxia-image-min
    axxia-image-dev
    axxia-image-qsp (require 'qsp' distro feature)

For Multiple Configuration Build, use the following sintax:
    bitbake [mc:multiconfigname:]target [[[mc:multiconfigname:]target] ... ]
    bitbake mc::axxia-image-dev mc:grr:axxia-image-run mc:qsp:axxia-image-qsp

Other common targets are:
    core-image-minimal
    core-image-full-cmdline
    core-image-sato
    core-image-weston
    meta-toolchain
    meta-ide-support

You can also run generated qemu images with a command like 'runqemu qemux86-64'.

 - 'devtool' and 'recipetool' handle common recipe tasks
 - 'bitbake-layers' handles common layer tasks
 - 'oe-pkgdata-util' handles common target package tasks
