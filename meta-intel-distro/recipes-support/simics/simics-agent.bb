SUMMARY = "Simics agent that communicates with the Simics simulator via magic instructions"
DESCRIPTION="The Simics agent is a user-level program that communicates with the Simics \
simulator via magic instructions â€“ this makes it very easy to port to a new system, and \
it can effectively punch through layers of hypervisors and operating systems since it does \
not need to get down to memory-mapped devices in hardware."
