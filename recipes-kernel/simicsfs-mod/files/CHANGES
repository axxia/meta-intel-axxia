========

1.21 * Added support for Linux kernel version 4.9.
     * inode_change_ok replaced by setattr_prepare.

1.20 * Added support for kernel versions up to 4.8.
     * PAGE_CACHE_* macros removed, replace with PAGE_*.
     * follow_link removed from inode_operations, replace with get_link.
     * readlink_copy removed, replace with generic_readlink.
     * New debug level argument to the kernel module.

1.19 * Added support for kernel versions up to 4.3.

1.18 * Added support for 3.16 kernels.
     * Updated the README with more information about building
     * Added information about finding a physical address to the README
     * Provide the README also in HTML and PDF formats

1.17 * Remove support for kernels < 2.6.12, since they are untested.
     * Update to linux coding style.
     * Fixed compilation for kernel 3.14 when CONFIG_USER_NS is set.
     * Fixed a compilation issue for kernel 3.15, where
       - vfs_readlink is replaced by readlink_copy

1.16 * Fixed compilation for kernels >= 3.10. Bug 20435.
     * Fixed compilation for kernel 2.6.28. Bug 17663.
     * Avoid buffer overflow in hostfs_lookup_inode. Bug 19698.

1.15 * Fixed compilation on kernels >= 3.4. Bug 18651.

1.14 * Fixed compilation on kernels >= 3.2. Bug 18089.

1.13 * Made CONFIG_SIMICSFS_ADDRESS depend on CONFIG_SIMICSFS. Bug 16696.
     * Fixed compilation warnings on linux kernels >= 2.6.34
     * Fix compilation on kernels >= 2.6.39
       - .get_fs is replaced by .mount
       - SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED replaced by run-time initialization
     * Allocate large buffers on the heap instead of the stack to reduce the
       risk of stack overflow. Found by the -Wframe-larger-than=1024 option.
       Bug 16856.
     * Known failure to compile on kernel == 2.6.28, missing function
       ‘grab_cache_page_write_begin’, bug 17663.

1.12 * Added SimicsFS Kconfig file. fs/Kconfig should be updated to source it.
       See README_2.6 for more information. Bug 14266.
     * Added support for M68K.
     * Removed support for setting the hostfs physical address using
       "simicsfs=0xf00ba0". Use "simicsfs.phys_addr=0xf00ba0" instead.
     * Made the default hostfs physical address configurable. This is done
       by setting the kernel config option CONFIG_SIMICSFS_ADDRESS.
     * Fix compilation on linux kernels >= 2.6.36
       - removed .truncate
       - .setattr updated to handle ATTR_SIZE
       - .setattr updated to not call inode_setattr

1.11 * Support > 32-bit hfs addresses on 32-bit targets
     * Fixed typo in hostfs.h which can to lead to compiler errors,
       depending on target

1.10 * Replace ClearPageLocked with unlock_page on kernels 2.6.27 and newer.
     * Replace address_space_operations functions prepare_write and commit_write
       with write_begin and write_end on kernels 2.6.28 and newer.
     * Add MIPS support for 2.6 compilation (tested with 2.6.23).

1.9 * Revalidate inode before read/write/getattr accesses; this fixes issues
      with changes made from the host system not being seen on the target.
      For performance reasons, mount /host with noatime.

    * Fix compilation on linux kernels >= 2.6.19:
        - aio_read/aio_write prototype changed

    * Fix compilation on linux kernels >= 2.6.25:
        - iget removed
        - .inode_read removed

1.8 * Use struct path instead of accessing f_dentry directly
      on linux kernels >= 2.6.20
      Fixed kernel crash issue introduced in 1.7.

1.7 * Fix compilation on linux kernels >= 2.6.18:
        - get_sb* prototypes changed
        - statfs prototypes changed

    * Fix compilation on linux kernels >= 2.6.19:
        - error: linux/config.h: No such file or directory
        - error: 'struct inode' has no member named 'i_blksize'
        - warning: implicit declaration of function 'generic_file_read/write'

1.6 * Support passing of hostfs device address via kernel command line or
      module parameter on 2.6.x kernels.

    * Fixed a bug in read that caused kernels with highmem support to crash.

1.5 * Support for new simicsfs interface on UltraSPARC machines. Requires
      Simics build 1336 or newer.

    * Support for ARM targets.

1.4 * Fix compilation on kernels >= 2.6.13 (follow_link prototype changed).

1.3 * Fix crash when unmounting on 2.6.x kernels.

1.2 * Corrected hostfs device address for SPARC (SunFire) target, that works
      with 2.6 kernel.

    * Simplified build of kernel module for a Linux 2.6 kernel.

1.1 * Added support for Linux 2.6 kernels.

1.0 * Base version
