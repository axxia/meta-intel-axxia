OpenEmbedded/Yocto layers
=========================

This repository is hosting the following modular layers:

meta-intel-snr
--------------
This is the OpenEmbedded/Yocto layer for Intel Axxia SnowRidge BSP.
This layer contains the official machine configuration file and kernel
recipes with patches and fragments. This layer depends on meta-intel
layer. Check README.snr for more details.

meta-intel-rdk
--------------
This is the OpenEmbedded/Yocto layer for Intel Axxia RDK components.
This layer contains metadata for RDK kernel modules (including ADK NetD)
and RDK userspace tools. This layer depends on meta-intel-snr layer and
its dependencies. Check README.rdk for more details.

meta-intel-vcn
--------------
This is the OpenEmbedded/Yocto layer containing metadata to build a full
Intel Axxia reference platform for Victoria Canyon board and simulation/
emulation systems. This layer depends on meta-intel-snr layer and its
dependencies. Check README.vcn for more details.
