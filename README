OpenEmbedded/Yocto layers
=========================

This repository is hosting the following modular layers:

meta-intel-bsp
--------------
This is the OpenEmbedded/Yocto layer for Intel Axxia x86_64 BSPs based
on Intel Snow Ridge and Intel Grand Ridge CPUs.
This layer contains the official machine configuration file and kernel
recipes with patches and fragments. This layer depends on meta-intel
layer. Check README.bsp for more details.

meta-intel-rdk
--------------
This is the OpenEmbedded/Yocto layer for Intel Axxia RDK components.
This layer contains metadata for RDK kernel modules (including ADK NetD)
and RDK userspace tools. This layer depends on meta-intel-bsp layer and
its dependencies. Check README.rdk for more details.

meta-intel-distro
-----------------
This is the OpenEmbedded/Yocto layer containing metadata to build a full
Intel Axxia reference platform for Victoria Canyon board (VCN) for SNR
machine, Travertine Fall board (TVF) for GRR machine and simulation
systems. This layer depends on meta-intel-bsp layer and its dependencies.
Check README.distro for more details.
