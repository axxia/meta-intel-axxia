Building the meta-axxia BSP layer
-------------------------------

To begin using the Yocto Project build tools, you must first setup your work
environment and verify that that you have the required host packages installed
on the system you will be using for builds. 

Check the YOCTO Reference Manual for the system you are using and verify you
have the minimum required packages installed. 
http://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/current/ref-manual/ref-manual.html

NOTE: You may also require packages: u-boot-tools (mkimage) and
device-tree-compiler (dtc)

1. Create an empty build directory and verify that the partition has at least
50Gb of free space. Next set an environment variable, YOCTO, to the full path.

   $ cd $HOME
   $ df -h .  # verify output shows adequate space available
   $ mkdir yocto
   $ cd yocto
   $ export YOCTO=$HOME/yocto # should also add this to your ~/.bashrc file. 

2. Clone the Yocto Project build tools (Poky) environment.

   $ cd $YOCTO
   $ git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky.git
   $ cd poky
   $ git checkout morty

3. Clone the Axxia meta layer. This provides meta data for building images for the
Axxia specific board types.

   $ cd $YOCTO/poky
   $ git clone https://github.com/axxia/meta-axxia.git
   $ cd meta-axxia
   $ git checkout morty

4. The Open Embedded project provides many useful layers and packages such as
networking. Download the Open Embedded Yocto Project hosted repository with the
following.

   $ cd $YOCTO/poky
   $ git clone https://github.com/openembedded/meta-openembedded.git
   $ cd meta-openembedded
   $ git checkout morty

5. Clone Yocto Virtualization Layer which provides packages for virtualization 
such as Linux Container Support (lxc).

   $ cd $YOCTO/poky
   $ git clone https://git.yoctoproject.org/git/meta-virtualization
   $ cd meta-virtualization
   $ git checkout morty

6. Create the build directory. The name is optional and will default to 'build',
however it helps to choose a name to match the board type. For example, we will
use axxia.

   $ cd $YOCTO
   $ source poky/oe-init-build-env axxia

7. Edit the conf/bblayers.conf file

   $ pwd (you should be at $YOCTO/axxia)
   $ vi conf/bblayers.conf

Edit BBLAYERS variable as follows. Replace references to $YOCTO below with the
actual value you provided in step 1.

   BBLAYERS ?= " \
            $YOCTO/poky/meta \
            $YOCTO/poky/meta-yocto \
            $YOCTO/poky/meta-yocto-bsp \
            $YOCTO/poky/meta-openembedded/meta-oe \
            $YOCTO/poky/meta-openembedded/meta-python \
            $YOCTO/poky/meta-openembedded/meta-networking \
            $YOCTO/poky/meta-axxia \
            "

8. Edit the conf/local.conf file:
   $ vi conf/local.conf

8.1 Depending on your processor, set these two options that control how much
parallelism BitBake should use:

  BB_NUMBER_THREADS = "12"
  PARALLEL_MAKE = "-j 12"

8.2 Select a specific machine to target the build with:

  MACHINE = "axxiaarm"
  or
  MACHINE = "axxiaarm64"
  or
  MACHINE = "axxiapowerpc"
  or
  MACHINE = "axxiax86_64"

8.3 Select the root filesystem image compression type (can set multiple types):
NOTE: Default types are set for each machine configuration file from conf/machine.

  IMAGE_FSTYPES += "ext2"
  IMAGE_FSTYPES += "tar.gz"
  IMAGE_FSTYPES += "hddimg"

8.4 Select the custom bootloader as preferred:

  PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/bootloader = "u-boot-axxia"

8.5 Select the KERNEL type:
   for standard
   PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/kernel = "linux-yocto"

   for preempt-rt
   PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/kernel = "linux-yocto-rt"

8.6 Select the kernel version:
NOTE: axxiaarm and axxiaarm64 are available with linux 4.1 and 4.9
      axxiax86_64 is available with linux 4.8 and 4.9

   for 4.1, depending on PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/kernel
   PREFERRED_VERSION_linux-yocto = "4.1%"
   PREFERRED_VERSION_linux-yocto-rt = "4.1"

   for 4.8, depending on PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/kernel
   PREFERRED_VERSION_linux-yocto = "4.8%"
   PREFERRED_VERSION_linux-yocto-rt = "4.8%"

   for 4.9, depending on PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/kernel
   PREFERRED_VERSION_linux-yocto = "4.9%"
   PREFERRED_VERSION_linux-yocto-rt = "4.9%"
  
8.7 Select the kernel repository to use. Meta-axxia is able to build the kernel
from 2 sources: private axxiagithub and public YOCTO kernel repo depending on
AXXIA_SRC variable from local.conf:

a. by default (missing to set AXXIA_SRC) or setting

   AXXIA_SRC = "linux-yocto"

   will build from Yocto repos:
   4.1: http://git.yoctoproject.org/git/linux-yocto-4.1
        standard/axxia/base or standard/preempt-rt/axxia/base branch
   4.8: http://git.yoctoproject.org/git/linux-yocto-4.8 
        standard/base or standard/preempt-rt/base branch
   4.9: http://git.yoctoproject.org/git/linux-yocto-4.9 
        standard/axxia/base or standard/preempt-rt/axxia/base branch

b. AXXIA_SRC = "axxia-tip" (not available for linux 4.8)
   
   will build kernel from GitHub private repos (require authentication with
   public key):
   4.1: git@github.com:axxia/axxia_yocto_linux_4.1_private.git
        standard/axxia-dev/base or standard/preempt-rt/axxia/base branch
   4.9: git@github.com:axxia/axxia_yocto_linux_4.9_private.git
        standard/axxia-dev/base or standard/preempt-rt/axxia/base branch

8.8 Customizing the Kernel .config file
NOTE: This options are available only with AXXIA_SRC = "linux-yocto"
      When building from github, fixed defconfigs are used instead.

When building the kernel from the Yocto repositories, the final .config is built
using configuration fragments. Otherwise, when building from axxiagithub,
an defconfig is used.
Besides the options specific to the standard and preempt-rt kernel, you are able
to add extra kernel fragments by setting the following options:

a. Power management scheme (axxiaarm and axxiaarm64 only):
   - POWER_MANAGEMENT = "low-power" (DEFAULT)
     to keep the core low power when is shut down
   - POWER_MANAGEMENT = "full-power"
     to complete power down the core when is shut down
   - POWER_MANAGEMENT = "full-power-L2"
     to complete power down the core and L2 cache when is shut down

b. Big-endian or little-endian (axxiaarm and axxiaarm64 only):
Set the order in which a sequence of bytes are stored in computer memory.
   - BIG_ENDIAN = "no" (DEFAULT)
     Little-endian is the default settings.
   - BIG_ENDIAN = "yes"
     Kernel will be built with CONFIG_CPU_BIG_ENDIAN enabled.

c. Debug options (axxiaarm and axxiaarm64 only):
   - DBG = "no" (DEFAULT)
   - DBG = "yes"
     Will enable options for debug in the Kernel config.

d. SMP options (axxiaarm and axxiaarm64 only):
   - SMP = "yes" (DEFAULT)
   - SMP = "no"
     Will enable or disable SMP related kernel options.

e. Regression testing (axxiaarm and axxiaarm64 only):
    TESTING = "yes"

f. Chip specific options (for axxiaarm64):
    CHIPSET = "X9" -> add X9 specific kernel options
    CHIPSET = "XLF" -> add XLF specific kernel options

Note: CHIPSET variable is also used for fine tuning (see 7.9) and to choose the
proper defconfig for Github builds (see 7.7).

8.9 Choose proper fine tuning for each CHIPSET
As long as specfic tunes are defined, user can choose the proper 
tune using the CHIPSET variable. Features and flags for each tune
are defined bellow:

- for axxiaarm:
    - CHIPSET = "5500" (DEFAULT) -> default tune: cortexa15-neon
        - TUNE_FEATURES = "arm armv7ve vfp  neon"
        - CFLAGS = "arm-poky-linux-gnueabi-gcc  -march=armv7ve -mfpu=neon
                    -mfloat-abi=softfp 

    - CHIPSET = "X9" -> default tune: cortexa57_32-crypto
        - TUNE_FEATURES = "arm aarch32 neon fp-armv8 callconvention-hard 
                           crypto  cortexa57"
        - CFLAGS = "arm-poky-linux-gnueabi-gcc  -mfpu=crypto-neon-fp-armv8  
                    -mfloat-abi=hard -mcpu=cortex-a57 -mtune=cortex-a57"

    - CHIPSET = "XLF" -> default tune: cortexa53_32-crypto
        - TUNE_FEATURES = "arm aarch32 neon fp-armv8 callconvention-hard 
                           crypto  cortexa53"
        - CFLAGS = "arm-poky-linux-gnueabi-gcc  -mfpu=crypto-neon-fp-armv8 
                    -mfloat-abi=hard -mcpu=cortex-a53 -mtune=cortex-a53"

- for axxiaarm64:
    - CHIPSET = "X9" (DEFAULT) -> default tune: cortexa57_64-crypto
        - TUNE_FEATURES = "aarch64 crypto cortexa57"
        - CFLAGS = "aarch64-poky-linux-gcc  -march=armv8-a+crypto 
                    -mcpu=cortex-a57+crypto -mtune=cortex-a57"

    - CHIPSET = "XLF" -> default tune: cortexa53_64-crypto
        - TUNE_FEATURES = "aarch64 crypto cortexa53"
        - CFLAGS = "aarch64-poky-linux-gcc  -march=armv8-a+crypto 
                    -mcpu=cortex-a53+crypto -mtune=cortex-a53"

NOTE: For ARMv8, AArch64 state, other availabe tunes are for BE with 
          and without crypto (crypto enables olso floating point and advanced 
          SIMD). See conf/machine/include/arm/arch-armv8a.inc
      For ARMv8, AArch32 state, default tunes include hard float, fp-armv8 
          floating-point, thumb and neon extensions. Crypto, thumb and BE are 
          optional.

- for axxiax86-64:
    - default tune: corei7-64
    - TUNE_FEATURES = "m64 corei7"
 
NOTE: For axxiax86-64 machine, no CHIPSET variable should be set.

8.10 Building a 32-bit RootFS for ARMv8 based boards:
For ARM architecture, depending on the machine selected on step 7.2, 
specific Kernel and RootFS are built for specific boards:
    - axxiaarm: 32-bit Kernel and Rootfs for 5500 board series which have
                ARMv7 based processors (cortex-a15)
    - axxiaarm64: 64-bit Kernel and Rootfs for 5600 board series which have
                  ARMv8 based processors (cortex-a53 for XLF board or 
                  cortex-a57 for X9 board).
But ARMv8 architecture support both 32-bit and 64-bit instruction sets. 
To build a 32-bit Kernel and RootFS for ARMv8, you will need to set the
following variables in local.conf:

   MACHINE = "axxiaarm"   # for 32-bit 
   CHIPSET = "X9" of CHIPSET = "XLF" (see 7.9)  # for 5600 boards (ARMv8)

If CHIPSET is not set, it will default to 5500 (ARMv7).

NOTE: You can boot the resulting 32-bit RootFS with a 64-bit Kernel 
      resulting from an axxiaarm64 build.

8.11 Other optional settings for saving disk space and build time:
   
   DL_DIR = "/<some-shared-location>/downloads"
   SSTATE_DIR = "/<some-shared-location>/sstate-cache

8.12 Example. Append these lines to conf/local.conf file from the build dir

BB_NUMBER_THREADS = "12"
PARALLEL_MAKE = "-j 12"
MACHINE = "axxiaarm64"
IMAGE_FSTYPES += "ext2"
IMAGE_FSTYPES += "tar.gz"
PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/bootloader = "u-boot-axxia"
PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/kernel = "linux-yocto-rt"
PREFERRED_VERSION_linux-yocto-rt = "4.1%"
AXXIA_SRC = "linux-yocto"
DBG = "yes"
SMP = "yes"
TESTING = "yes"
DL_DIR = "/<some-shared-location>/downloads"
SSTATE_DIR = "/<some-shared-location>/sstate-cache"


9. Select the image type and start the build
   $ cd $YOCTO/axxia
   $ bitbake <image type>

Available root filesystem types:
   * axxia-image-small 
     A small image used in simulation, flash, or as a ram disk. Should be
     sufficient to use the RTE. 

   * axxia-image-sim
     An image used in simulation.

   * axxia-image-large
     A more complete image.

   * axxia-image-large-sdk
     Image that includes everything within axxia-image-large plus meta-toolchain, 
     development headers and libraries to form a standalone SDK.

Once complete the images for the target machine will be available in the output
directory 'tmp/deploy/images/$MACHINE'.

10. Images generated:

* <image type>-<machine name>.ext2 (rootfs in EXT2 format)
* <image type>-<machine name>.tar.gz (rootfs in tar+GZIP format)
* modules-<machine name>.tgz (modules in tar+GZIP format)
* zImage and zImage-<machine name> (Linux Kernel binary, in u-boot wrapped 
format)
NOTE: For axxiaarm64, only Image files are generated, instead of zImage.
      Use mkimage to convert them to zImage format. 
* <target name>.dtb
* FIT images, 3 types:
	* fdt.fit-<target name> (DTB in fit image format)
	* linux.fit-<target name> (Kernel binary in fit image format)
	* multi.fit-<target name> (Kernel binary + DTB in fit image format)
* <image type>-<machine name>.hddimg (rootfs in hddimg format - axxiaarmx86-64)
* <image type>-<machine name>.wic (rootfs in wic format - axxiaarmx86-64)
