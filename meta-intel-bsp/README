meta-intel-bsp
==============

This is the OpenEmbedded/Yocto layer for Intel Axxia x86_64 BSPs based
on Intel Snow Ridge, Intel Grand Ridge and Intel Palm Ridge CPUs.
This layer contains the official machine configuration file and kernel
recipes with patches and fragments.


Supported MACHINES
==================

- intel-axxia-snr - This BSP is optimized for Intel Axxia x86 Gen3 Mobile &
  Enterprise Communication Processors family (64-bit) such as Snow Ridge SoCs.

- intel-axxia-grr - This BSP is optimized for Intel Axxia x86 Gen4 Mobile &
  Enterprise Communication Processors family (64-bit) such as Grand Ridge SoCs.

- intel-axxia-pmr - This BSP is optimized for Intel Axxia x86 Gen5 Mobile &
  Enterprise Communication Processors family (64-bit) such as Palm Ridge SoCs.

Please refer to the associate .conf for more information.


Reference platforms
===================

- Victoria Canyon board (VCN) for SNR machine

- Travertine Fall board (TVF) for GRR machine

- Advanced Simulation Environment (ASE)

I. Back Ported Linux Changes
============================

Some changes have been up-streamed, but have not yet been back ported
to Linux 6.1. Some of these have been added to this meta layer.
The changes are described below. In each case, any changes required are
described and the publically available patch is referenced. Only changes
functionally required for internal testing have been back ported.

The "title" of the commit (Subject: or first line) is used to identify
the commit, as this is the easiest way to find it in the repositories.

In the following descriptions, "with no changes" means that a patch
was obtained using 'git format-patch -1 <sha>' from the referenced
respoistory and was applied using 'git am -3 <patch>'.

In the meta layer, the patches for Linux 6.1 can be found in
meta-intel-bsp/recipes-kernel/linux/patches/6.1.


drivers/watchdog: Ignore 'No Reboot' Bit
----------------------------------------

This has not been upstreamed, and there is no plan to upstream it.

Early versions of the SNR chip do not allow the "no reboot" bit to be
accessed.  This commit simply assumes that it is writeable without
checking in order to allow the watchdog to but used in Linux.  This
will be fixed in later versions of the chip.

Note that, by default, this patch will do nothing.  To enable it, add
'iTCO_wdt.assume_noreboot_access=1' to the Linux command line.

Included as 0001-drivers-watchdog-Ignore-No-Reboot-Bit.patch


clocksource: Add option to force acpi_pm as clocksource watchdog
----------------------------------------------------------------

Add a kernel command line option to force the use of acpi_pm as the
watchdog clocksource. To use it, add the following to the kernel
command line:

    ricardo_clocksource_wd=force_acpi_pm_wd

and in dmesg look for:

    RICARDO: Force acpi_pm as watchdog

Included as
0002-clocksource-Add-option-to-force-acpi_pm-as-clocksour.patch


Support for SIOV (for GRR and PMR)
----------------------------------

0001-platform-msi-Add-device-MSI-infrastructure.patch
0002-genirq-msi-Provide-helpers-to-return-Linux-IRQ-dev_m.patch


II. Building meta-intel-bsp
===========================

1. Build Intel Axxia reference platform
---------------------------------------

To build a full Intel Axxia reference platform, please follow the
instructions from README.distro file.


2. Build with other OpenEmbedded/Yocto layers
---------------------------------------------

In order to build meta-intel-bsp layer with other yocto-compatible layers,
such as Wind River Linux ones, the following additional steps
are required:

    bitbake-layers add-layer <path-to-layer>/meta-intel
    bitbake-layers add-layer <path-to-layer>/meta-intel-bsp

In local.conf, set intel-axxia-snr or intel-axxia-grr machine, choose
linux-intel kernel provider and add to the white list the following
packages if necesary:

    PNWHITELIST_intel += " thermald intel-microcode iucode-tool"
    PNWHITELIST_intel += " linux-intel linux-intel-rt"
    
Also, be sure linux-intel is not blacklisted somewhere in other layers.
